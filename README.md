# ML-Based Stroke Prediction Model 🧠
This project leverages Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) 🧠 to predict stroke risk with 81% accuracy ✅, utilizing key health indicators such as hypertension, BMI, glucose levels, and smoking status. It includes a Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation, alongside Streamlit code files 🖥️ that deploy the trained model into an interactive web application 🌐. The complete workflow—from data exploration 🔍 to real-time prediction is structured for clarity, reproducibility, and user engagement.
