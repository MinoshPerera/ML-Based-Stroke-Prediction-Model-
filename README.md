# ML-Based Stroke Prediction Model
This study leverages Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict stroke risk with 81% accuracy, utilizing key health indicators such as hypertension, BMI, glucose levels, and smoking status. By implementing advanced data preprocessing techniques (SMOTE, feature scaling, and encoding), this model enhances early detection and intervention.
